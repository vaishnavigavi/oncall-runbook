# Service Level Objectives (SLO) Policy

## Overview
This document defines the Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for our critical services and the processes for monitoring and maintaining them.

## SLO Definitions

### Availability SLOs
- **Critical Services**: 99.9% uptime (8.76 hours downtime per year)
- **Core Services**: 99.5% uptime (43.8 hours downtime per year)
- **Supporting Services**: 99.0% uptime (87.6 hours downtime per year)

### Performance SLOs
- **API Response Time**: 95th percentile < 500ms
- **Database Query Time**: 95th percentile < 100ms
- **Page Load Time**: 95th percentile < 2 seconds

### Error Rate SLOs
- **Critical Services**: < 0.1% error rate
- **Core Services**: < 0.5% error rate
- **Supporting Services**: < 1.0% error rate

## Service Classification

### Critical Services
- Payment processing
- User authentication
- Core database
- Load balancers

### Core Services
- User management
- Content delivery
- Analytics
- Monitoring systems

### Supporting Services
- Reporting tools
- Admin interfaces
- Development tools
- Documentation systems

## SLO Measurement

### Availability Calculation
```
Availability = (Total Time - Downtime) / Total Time
Downtime = Sum of all unplanned outages
```

### Performance Calculation
- Response time percentiles from APM tools
- Database query performance metrics
- Frontend performance metrics

### Error Rate Calculation
```
Error Rate = Failed Requests / Total Requests
```

## Monitoring & Alerting

### SLO Dashboards
- Real-time SLO status
- Historical trends
- Service-specific metrics
- Team accountability

### Alerting Rules
- **Warning**: SLO approaching threshold (80% of limit)
- **Critical**: SLO breached
- **Escalation**: SLO breached for extended period

### Escalation Path
1. OnCall engineer notification
2. Team lead notification
3. Engineering manager notification
4. Executive notification

## SLO Violation Response

### Immediate Actions
1. Acknowledge violation
2. Assess impact
3. Begin investigation
4. Implement workaround if possible

### Investigation Process
1. Root cause analysis
2. Impact assessment
3. Timeline documentation
4. Resolution implementation

### Post-Violation Actions
1. Post-mortem analysis
2. SLO adjustment if needed
3. Process improvements
4. Documentation updates

## SLO Review & Updates

### Quarterly Reviews
- SLO performance analysis
- Threshold adjustments
- Service reclassification
- Process improvements

### Annual Reviews
- Comprehensive SLO assessment
- Industry benchmark comparison

- Cross-team SLO sharing
- Best practice documentation

## Success Metrics

### SLO Achievement
- Percentage of SLOs met
- Trend of SLO performance
- Reduction in violations
- Improvement in user experience

### Process Efficiency
