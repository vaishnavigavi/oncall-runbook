# Incident Response Guide

## Incident Classification

### Severity Levels
- **P0 (Critical)**: Service completely down, data loss, security breach
- **P1 (High)**: Major feature unavailable, significant performance degradation
- **P2 (Medium)**: Minor feature unavailable, moderate performance impact
- **P3 (Low)**: Cosmetic issues, minor bugs

### Response Times
- P0: Immediate response (< 5 minutes)
- P1: Response within 15 minutes
- P2: Response within 1 hour
- P3: Response within 4 hours

## Incident Response Process

### 1. Detection & Alerting
- Monitor alerting systems
- Verify incident is real (not a false positive)
- Determine initial severity level

### 2. Initial Response
- Acknowledge incident
- Create incident ticket
- Notify stakeholders
- Begin investigation

### 3. Investigation
- Gather information about the incident
- Identify root cause
- Assess impact scope
- Document findings

### 4. Resolution
- Implement fix or workaround
- Verify resolution
- Monitor for recurrence
- Update incident status

### 5. Post-Incident
- Conduct post-mortem
- Document lessons learned
- Update runbooks and procedures
- Implement preventive measures

## Communication

### Stakeholder Updates
- Engineering teams
- Product management
- Customer support
- Executive leadership
- External customers (if applicable)

### Update Frequency
- P0: Every 30 minutes
- P1: Every hour
- P2: Every 4 hours
- P3: Daily

## Tools & Resources

### Monitoring
- Grafana dashboards
- Log aggregation systems
- APM tools
- Health check endpoints

### Communication
- Slack channels
- Email lists
- Status page updates
- Conference bridges

## Common Scenarios

### Database Issues
- Check connection pools
- Review query performance
- Verify backup status
- Consider failover options

### API Failures

- Review error logs
- Verify dependencies
- Check rate limiting

### Performance Degradation
- Analyze metrics
- Check resource usage
- Review recent deployments
- Identify bottlenecks

## Escalation Path

1. OnCall engineer
2. Team lead
3. Engineering manager
4. CTO/VP Engineering
5. CEO (for P0 incidents)

## Documentation Requirements

- Incident summary
- Timeline of events
- Root cause analysis
- Resolution steps
- Lessons learned
- Action items
